# Node-Tys-bookApp
A book app store using nodejs and typescript.

This app was done following the next tutorial, from Fazt. is a good tutorial if you do not have a lot idea about Typescript.
it was a fun process, but i know is almost completed, what need is that the user should be able to delete and update.

this is the link to the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UipIQ81kabs&list=PLxQEvYh-BWSAE2UioFHUBO_8W-IYu20dM&index=34&t=4556s
